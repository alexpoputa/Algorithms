/* Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3]. */

function almostIncreasingSequence(seq) {
  var bad=0
  for(var i=1;i<seq.length;i++) if(seq[i]<=seq[i-1]) {
    bad++
    if(bad>1) return false
    if(seq[i]<=seq[i-2]&&seq[i+1]<=seq[i-1]) return false
  }
  return true
